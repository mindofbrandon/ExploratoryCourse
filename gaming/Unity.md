1. Set Up Project: Create a new Unity project and set up your project settings, including platform targeting, input settings, and player settings.
2. Scene Setup:
Set up a basic scene with terrain or placeholder environment assets.
Add a player character model and set up animations for basic movement (e.g., running, idle).
Set up a third-person camera system to follow the player character.
3. Player Movement:
Implement basic player movement controls using Unity's input system or a third-party input manager.
Set up character controller or Rigidbody-based movement for the player character.
Implement jumping, sprinting, and other movement mechanics as needed.
4. Networking Setup:
Choose a networking solution for multiplayer functionality (e.g., Unity Multiplayer Services, Photon Unity Networking, Mirror).
Set up network manager and networked player prefabs.
Implement player spawning and synchronization across the network.
5. Random Generation:
Research and choose appropriate techniques for procedural world generation (e.g., Perlin noise, cellular automata, tile-based generation).
Develop algorithms to generate terrain features such as terrain height, textures, and objects placement.
Implement random generation scripts and integrate them into your scene.
6. Battle System:
Design the battle mechanics, including turn-based combat, move sets, and stats (similar to Pok√©mon).
Create battle scenes or arenas where battles take place.
Implement a system for initiating battles with wild creatures or other players.
Develop UI elements for displaying battle information, such as health bars and move selection menus.
Implement logic for resolving battles, including calculating damage, status effects, and victory conditions.
7. UI Design:
Design user interface elements for displaying player information, inventory, and game menus.
Implement UI elements using Unity's UI system or a third-party UI toolkit.
Ensure UI elements are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
8. Testing and Iteration:
Test each component of your game individually to ensure functionality and identify any bugs or issues.
Playtest the game as a whole to evaluate gameplay balance, pacing, and overall player experience.
Iterate on your designs based on feedback from testing and playtesting sessions.
9. Documentation and Refinement:
Document your game design, including mechanics, systems, and assets used.
Refine and optimize your code, assets, and gameplay mechanics based on performance and player feedback.
Continuously update and improve your game based on ongoing testing and development.
